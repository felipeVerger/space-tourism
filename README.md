## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/overview) - JS library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React Library for animation

### What I learned

During this project I decided to make the animations with framer motion, a very practical and effective React library. I learned how to use this powerful tool with many features, for example its "animate", "initial", "transition" props and more. I highly recommend this library, it is super powerful and simple.

### Continued development

Despite everything I learned about framer motion, this library has so many functions that I haven't used even half of it, that's why I would like to go deeper into the use of this technology. Finally I consider that my code has some improvements, so at some point I will continue to optimize this app.
